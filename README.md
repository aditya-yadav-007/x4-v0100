Yo.

Thank You for giving time to this project. I made this project in my drop year, after 12th.

My main reason for making this project is to understand how CPU works and the best way to learn something is by making them.

I made this in "Digital-Logic-Sim" by Sebastian Lague.

I will be making max to max 2 more versions v0200 and v0300.

I named this after my caring Sister Akansha. She stood as one of the most motivating pillars for this project.

I tried categorising the documents as much I can.
